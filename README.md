In my project, Patient Appointment Management System, I worked on patient appointment booking. I used MySQL as my data base and Java to complete patient appointment booking.
As the receptionist, I must view the patients' list and the doctors' availability. I scheduled doctor appointments for every 30 minutes from 9:30 AM to 2:00 PM, making sure the slots were open before scheduling. If the doctor been available, I would have gone forward with the appointment.
I tested the connection to the database, the logging of the front desk, and the appointment booking using Junit.
